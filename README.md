 website for displaying agrometeological indicators 

The website has recently undergone significant enhancements to its multidimensional mosaic dataset, which presents a comprehensive view of multiple agrometeorological indicators in the UK. The dataset includes observations from the years 1961 to 2020, as well as ensemble mean projections spanning from 2021 to 2080.

In the latest update, 12 new ensembles have been added to the website. These additions have been made to highlight the differences between each ensemble, thus providing a more nuanced and detailed maps of the data. 
Additionally, the colour ramp for some of the indicators has been changed, which further enhances the clarity of the dataset.

To improve the user experience, an explanation for each indicator has been added to the hide side average maps. This feature will help users better understand the meaning and significance of each indicator and enable them to make more informed interpretations of the data.
